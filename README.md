## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fit-Rang/fitrang-main.git
cd fitrang-main
````

### 2. Run the Setup Script

This script clones all required microservices and frontend repos into the expected directory structure.

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
### 3. Start the Stack

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> This will spin up **Keycloak**, **Kong**, **Redis**, **Elasticsearch**, **all backend services**, and **frontend apps** (if configured as services).

## üß∞ Requirements

* Docker v20+
* Docker Compose v2.5+
